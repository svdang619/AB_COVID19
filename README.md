# Welcome

Welcome to the Alberta COVID-19 Flexdashboard created by Steven Dang. For quick access to the dashboard click [here](https://svdang619.github.io/AB_COVID19/)

The purpose of dashboard is to create a quick and easy visualization of what is happening in Alberta. Datasets are pulled from the [City of Edmonton Open Data Portal](https://data.edmonton.ca/).
New data is dependent on how often the datasets are updated by the City of Edmonton. For more information, please visit the "About" tab in the dashboard.

If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please e-mail me at stevendang619@outlook.com

Thanks for checking out my work!
